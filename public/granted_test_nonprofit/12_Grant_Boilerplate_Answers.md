## Organization Background (≈220 words)
Harbor Bridge Community Lab (HBCL) is a Solano County nonprofit dedicated to closing the digital divide and expanding economic mobility for under‑resourced youth and families. Founded in 2019, HBCL operates after‑school STEM labs, a mobile Tech Bus with bilingual digital navigators, and 12‑week reskilling bootcamps for young adults. Our approach blends culturally responsive teaching with rigorous measurement so learners gain both skills and confidence. In FY24, HBCL reached over 1,300 residents, with youth showing meaningful gains on curriculum‑aligned assessments and adults completing digital literacy checklists that translate to real‑world capability. We partner with libraries, schools, a community college, faith communities, and employers to extend reach and reduce costs. Systems include encrypted storage and role‑based access; policies cover youth safety, data privacy, ADA access, and non‑discrimination. With support, HBCL will scale cohort capacity, expand neighborhood pop‑ups, and strengthen workforce pipelines in high‑need areas across Vallejo, Fairfield, Suisun City, and Vacaville.

## Statement of Need (≈200 words)
Target neighborhoods in Solano County face persistent access barriers: unaffordable broadband and devices, limited digital confidence, and few localized training pathways that connect directly to work. Households in our focus tracts experience elevated rates of mobile‑only internet and youth underemployment, constraining academic success and family income growth. These challenges intersect with language access and housing instability, creating compounding barriers for Black, Latine, immigrant, and transitional‑age youth. The absence of neighborhood‑based services further widens opportunity gaps. HBCL’s integrated model—STEM labs, a mobile Tech Bus, and workforce reskilling—addresses access, skills, and opportunity simultaneously. By meeting residents where they are, providing culturally responsive instruction in English and Spanish, and connecting completers to internships and jobs, HBCL proposes a rapid, measurable reduction in digital access gaps and a clear on‑ramp to economic mobility over the next 12–24 months.

## Project Description & Activities (≈280 words)
HBCL seeks support to expand our three‑program model: (A) After‑School STEM Labs, (B) Mobile Tech Bus with digital navigators, and (C) Workforce Reskilling bootcamps. Funding will underwrite staffing, equipment, and participant supports to reach 260 youth, 1,200 residents, and 120 reskilling completers annually. Activities include 10‑week STEM cohorts culminating in public showcases and mentor talks; weekly neighborhood pop‑ups that provide device setup, ACP enrollment, and cyber hygiene workshops; and 12‑week, cohort‑based bootcamps (IT Support, Data Basics, AI Productivity) ending with employer days and mock interviews. Cross‑cutting supports include transportation vouchers, childcare during showcases, bilingual materials, and trauma‑informed facilitation. Evaluation uses pre/post skills tests, digital literacy checklists, LMS and attendance logs, and employer verification for placement. Findings are reviewed quarterly to improve fidelity and outcomes. The project will be delivered with partners (libraries, schools, community college, faith networks, and employers) with MoUs detailing roles, shared space, and referrals. A detailed budget allocates resources to personnel, equipment, stipends, and Tech Bus operations, keeping administration under 10%.

## SMART Objectives (Year 1)
1. Serve **260** youth in after‑school STEM labs; achieve **≥25%** average skills gain and **≥70%** confidence gain.  
2. Complete **400** ACP enrollments and **300** secure device setups; achieve **≥60%** 6‑month broadband retention.  
3. Graduate **120** young adults from reskilling; achieve **≥65%** placement/paid internship within 120 days; median wage **≥$20/hr**.

## Evaluation & Learning (≈140 words)
HBCL uses curriculum‑aligned pre/post assessments, digital literacy checklists, LMS activity logs, and employer verification to generate program dashboards. Data are disaggregated by age, zip code, language, and baseline access to ensure equity. A Data & Evaluation Lead oversees instruments, IRB posture, and ethics training. Findings are reviewed quarterly with staff and a Community Advisory Group to inform program improvements. Annual outcomes are summarized for partners and the board.

## Organizational Capacity (≈140 words)
HBCL employs 8 instructors and 6 digital navigators supported by leadership in programs, operations/safety, and evaluation. Facilities include a 2,400 sq ft HQ and a mobile Tech Bus equipped for instruction. Systems include encrypted storage and role‑based access. Policies cover youth safety, privacy, incident response, ADA access, and non‑discrimination. Partnerships with libraries, schools, a community college, faith networks, and employers extend reach and reduce costs.

## Budget & Sustainability (≈140 words)
The FY25 synthetic budget is **$625,000**. Personnel covers instructors, navigators, and coaches; non‑personnel covers equipment, software, and Tech Bus costs; administration remains under 10%. Revenue mix includes grants (60%), individuals (15%), corporate sponsors (15%), fee‑for‑service (5%), and in‑kind (5%). Sustainability strategies include multi‑year grants, public contracts, MoUs with partners for space/referrals, and earned‑income workshops for small businesses and agencies.
