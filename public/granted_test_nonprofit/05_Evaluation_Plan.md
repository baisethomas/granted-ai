## Learning Questions
1. To what extent do HBCL programs improve **skills, confidence, and access** for priority groups?
2. Which program elements drive the strongest outcomes (exposure, coaching, incentives)?
3. How do outcomes vary by neighborhood, language, and baseline access?

## KPIs
- **Program A (STEM Labs):** skills gain (%), confidence gain (%), internships (#), attendance rate (%).
- **Program B (Tech Bus):** ACP enrollments (#), device setups (#), digital literacy checklist completion (%), 6‑month broadband retention (%).
- **Program C (Reskilling):** completion rate (%), placement/paid internship rate (%), median starting wage ($), 90‑day retention (%).
